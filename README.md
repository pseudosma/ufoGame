# UFOMOFO

UFOMOFO is a work-in-progress side scroller for iOS built in a custom engine with roots in GCD and Core Graphics. The project file is a sample level and graphics tests for the assorted sprites. Use the pinch gesture to switch to the next test.

This was originally written in Objective-C, but the project will likely find new live as a browser-based game in the future.

## Techniques and Technology

This project demonstrates:

* Multi-threading through GCD
* Core Graphics vector effects
* Parallax effects
* Simple AI
* Simple game mechanics; sore -keeping and a timer

## Current status

Unfinished and pre-alpha, with many bugs to work out. Most gameplay mechanics are in a testing phase.
